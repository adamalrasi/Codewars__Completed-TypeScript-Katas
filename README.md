Completed Codewars Katas🐱‍👤
My Profile => [codewars.com/adamalrasi](https://www.codewars.com/users/adamalrasi)

This repository contains my solutions to most of the katas I have completed. I created this repository to track my progress and become a better programmer by writing cleaner, more efficient, and readable code.😎

But let's be honest, I'm still learning. So some of my code may be a bit hacky. But it works! And that's all that matters, right?😅

I hope you find my solutions helpful. And if you don't, well, at least you can get a good laugh out of them.🥳
